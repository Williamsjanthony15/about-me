        My Name is Anthony Williams. I am 25 years old. I am married to my
        highschool sweetheart Brittany Williams. I have 2 kids, 11 months and 4
        years old.

            Cool fact about those three. I asked her out on april 13th of 2012...
          Which is Friday the 13th. I proposed to her on Cinco de Mayo. Her
          birthday is March 17th which is St.Patricks Day, and my oldest son's
          birthday is also March 17th...but 21 years later. BUT WAIT.... Theres
          more... My youngest son was conceived on the same day as my first son,
          But he was born 18 days prior... If you do the math that would
          technically be Feburary 28th 2020.... But those who didnt know, 2020
          was a leap year. So there was 29 days in Feburary. Yes, you guessed
          it. My Second son was born on Leap Day of Leap Year. That means he
          would only have 1 birthday every 4 years. In turn, when he
          turned 84, it would technically actually be his 21st ACTUAL birthday. So... That means he can not drink
          until he is 84 years old.

            Now this is where i come in. I
        was born August 5th 1995. There is nothing special about my birthday. I was born and thats special enough for me! I was born
        in Florida and raised in Maine. My mother passed away in 2007 when i was
        11. She passed of Metastatic Melanoma, which now is one of the ONLY
        cancers that can be cured in Stage 4. 10 years to late, huh? I than
        moved to Colorado, where i met my gorgeous wife, graduated Highschool
        and enlisted for the Army.

            I Went to basic, got married, and was
        stationed in Joint-Base Lewis Mcchord all in 2013. By 2015 I re-classed into Aviation and than
        deployed right after. Upon return from Deployment i was medically
        discharged. I ended up being in the military 7 years. 2013 - 2020.  It made me really realize that i have to buck up and make a
        good career field and a simple life for my family.

            So i did. I am
        currently working full time as a system administrator for the department
        of defence. i am also currently holding a spot in the upcoming
        Spaceforce Software Development team that is being developed as we
        speak. When I graduate from Code Fellows 401 class with a focus on
        Python, i will fall into my Software Development spot and than work for
        the Department of Defence as a Gaurdian of the Galaxy. This is where i
        pose like Superman.
